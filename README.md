# Practical Python

_Session material and solutions for the Practical Python course at AZ Macclesfield_

Note, this course is now deprecated in place of the AstraZeneca Data Science Academy's [Data Science Python](https://github.com/semacu/data-science-python) course.

## Using This Repository

Each session is contained in its own folder and includes the Powerpoint presentation given in the session, solutions for the session execises in a Jupyter notebook, and a model solution for the session project as a Python script. 

The project solution is intended to be a model solution containing full documentation and testing. It is not expected for you to add such additional components to your solution but rather you should focus on the essential parts. A full solution is only provided as indication of the direction we want to be heading in and to build up experience with looking at source code.

## Session Summaries

### Session 1 - Cryptography

* Learn about list comprehension and functions for writing clear and efficient Python code
* Learn how to convert to and from ASCII-ordinal representations of characters
* Apply the session's techniques to create a simple cipher encrypter/decrypter

### Session 2 - Higher or Lower

* Learn about how dictionaries can be implemented and used in Python
* Learn how to randomly select items from a list/dictionary
* Apply the session's techniques (along with some supplied helper code) to create a game of 'Higher or Lower' using the follower counts of various celebrities' Twitters

### Session 3 - Life

* Learn how we can use lists of lists to create 2D arrays in Python
* Learn how to read text from a plain text file
* Apply the sessions's technique to simulate life itself (well, Conway's Game of Life). Additionally, allow the uploading of custom starting patterns
